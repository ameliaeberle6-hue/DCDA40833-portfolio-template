            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Brief intro to what you explored and why...</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT performed well when given clear, specific coding tasks, such as writing a simple Python function and explaining how it works. The generated code was easy to read and logically correct, making it useful as a learning and support tool. However, ChatGPT struggled when prompts were vague or lacked context. When asked to “optimize” code without additional details, the response was generic and based on assumptions, showing that the tool depends heavily on user input quality and cannot fully understand intent on its own.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT is best used as a learning aid, brainstorming tool, or in my case a coding assistant rather than a replacement for doing work independently. It is especially effective for understanding concepts and troubleshooting simple issues. A poor use case is relying on ChatGPT to complete entire assignments or submitting its output without understanding it.
          
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Using ChatGPT raises ethical concerns related to academic integrity and overreliance on AI tools. While ChatGPT can support learning, using it to replace independent thinking can weaken skill development and hinder academic expectations. To address these concerns ChatGPT sets boundaries such as refusing certain requests.

            <h2>Tool 2: Grammarly</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Grammarly’s AI performs well as a writing and editing tool, especially when improving grammar and sentence structure. When given a short paragraph, it quickly suggested revisions that made the writing more polished and professional. However, Grammarly AI sometimes went too far with rewrites, making the text sound less like my original voice and more generic. This showed that while the tool is effective for revision, it still requires human judgment to decide which suggestions to accept.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Grammarly AI is most appropriate as a revision and editing tool rather than a writing replacement. It works best when improving clarity, tone, and grammar in text that the user has already written. A poor use case is relying on Grammarly AI to generate entire paragraphs or assignments, since this can reduce originality and weaken the writer’s voice.
          
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p> Using Grammarly AI raises ethical concerns related to authorship, originality, and overreliance. While the tool helps improve writing quality, relying on AI-generated rewrites without reflection can weaken writing skills and reduce personal voice. Grammarly addresses some of these concerns by keeping users in control of suggestions and positioning AI as an editing assistant rather than a replacement for original writing. Ultimately, ethical use depends on the user’s decision-making and transparency.

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>I use ChatGPT a lot to come up with social media content ideas or brainstorm captions, and it has honestly become one of my go-to tools for staying creative and organized. When I feel stuck or like my ideas are starting to get repetitive, I’ll ask it to suggest prompts, angles, or ways to make a theme more fun or engaging. Even if the ideas aren’t perfect, they give me a starting point to tweak and make my own, which makes the process a lot less stressful. I also use it to experiment with tone, like deciding whether a caption should be funny, inspiring, or more casual, and then I build on that in my own voice. Beyond captions, I’ll sometimes use ChatGPT to help plan broader content, like mapping themes for a week of posts or thinking of ways to tie in trends. Grammarly comes into play more for refining writing, like making sure my sentences are clear, the grammar is correct, and the tone matches what I want to say. I don’t use it to write things for me, but it helps polish my work so it’s professional and easy to read. Using these tools together feels really normal because AI is now a standard part of workflows, not something unusual, and I think of it as an assistant that helps me get unstuck, stay organized, and refine my work, rather than replacing my own creativity or ideas. It allows me to focus more on storytelling, connection, and authenticity, which are the parts of social media and writing that are uniquely human. Overall, using AI this way helps me work efficiently while still keeping my voice, and it makes both content planning and writing less stressful and more fun.</p>
