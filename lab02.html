            <h2>Tool 1: [ChatGPT]</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT performed well when given clear, specific coding tasks, such as writing a simple Python function and explaining how it works. The generated code was easy to read and logically correct, making it useful as a learning and support tool. However, ChatGPT struggled when prompts were vague or lacked context. When asked to “optimize” code without additional details, the response was generic and based on assumptions, showing that the tool depends heavily on user input quality and cannot fully understand intent on its own.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT is best used as a learning aid, brainstorming tool, or in my case a coding assistant rather than a replacement for doing work independently. It is especially effective for understanding concepts and troubleshooting simple issues. A poor use case is relying on ChatGPT to complete entire assignments or submitting its output without understanding it.
          
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Using ChatGPT raises ethical concerns related to academic integrity and overreliance on AI tools. While ChatGPT can support learning, using it to replace independent thinking can weaken skill development and hinder academic expectations. To address these concerns ChatGPT sets boundaries such as refusing certain requests.
